Assignment 3 (Due Week 8)

This Assignment gets you to:

• Break a more complex problem down into simple steps to create an algorithm

• Use required modules

• Use the Selection and Repetition control structures 

 A positive integer greater than 1 is said to be prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. A positive integer greater than 1 is composite if it is not prime. Writen a program that asks the user to generate and display random odd numbers between 1 and 1001, then displays all of the prime numbers that are less than or equal to the number entered. The program should work as follows:
- Once the random number has been created, the program should populate a list with all integers from 2 up through the value entered.
- The program should then use a loop to step through the list. The loop should pass each element to a function that displays the element whether it is a prime number.
Coding requirements:
The program must include user-defined functions to modularize the code.
Make sure to put comments into your code (including your details at the top of the program)

import math
 
"""
 * check prime number
 * 
 * n: is interger
 * return true is prime number, 
 *         false is not prime number
"""
def isPrimeNumber(n):
    # integer n < 2 is not prime number
    if (n < 2):
        return False;
 
    # check prime number when n >= 2
    squareRoot = int(math.sqrt(n));
    for i in range(2, squareRoot + 1):
        if (n % i == 0):
            return False;
    return True;
    #input prime number n>=1 and n<=1001
n = int(input("Please input number between 1 to 1001 n = "));
if (n>=1 and n <=1001):
    print ("All prime number smaller than", n, "is:");
    sb = "";
    if (n >= 2 ):
        sb = sb + "2" + " ";
    for i in range (3, n+1):
        if (isPrimeNumber(i)):
            sb = sb + str(i) + " ";
        i = i + 2;
    print(sb);
else :
     print("Please input the number between 1 to 1001");
